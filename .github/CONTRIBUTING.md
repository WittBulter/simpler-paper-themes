DhyanaChina Contributing Guide    

### Pull Request Guidelines   
- Fork this repository to your own account. Do not create branches here.
- Commit info should be formatted as [Type]: Info about commit. (e.g. Build: Fix xxx bug)  
- Rebase before creating a PR to keep commit history clear.
- Merging a PR takes two maintainers: one approves the changes after reviewing, and then the other reviews and merges.
